##  Architecture (MVVM)

The **DirhamWay** mobile application is designed using the **Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)** architecture. This separation of concerns ensures a robust, testable, and scalable codebase. Below is a breakdown of each layer and its role in the project:

---

###  Model (`data/model/`)
**Purpose:** Represents the data structure and business logic of the application.




**Characteristics:**
- All models are stored locally using **Realm**, offering efficient, object-oriented data persistence.

---

###  ViewModel (`viewmodel/`)
**Purpose:** Acts as an intermediary between the `View` and `Model` layers.

**Responsibilities:**
- Exposes observable `LiveData` to the UI.
- Handles business logic such as filtering transactions, computing balances, and managing budget thresholds.
- Manages asynchronous operations like predictions using **TensorFlow Lite** or data retrieval from the **Realm** database.

---

###  View (`ui/`)
**Purpose:** Represents the user interface and handles user interactions.


**Tools Used:**
- **Android Jetpack** libraries such as `ViewModel`, `LiveData`, `RecyclerView`, and `Material Components`.

---

###  Repository (`data/repository/`)
**Purpose:** Abstracts the data access logic from ViewModels.

**Role:**
- Interacts directly with the **Realm database** for CRUD operations.
- Provides clean APIs for retrieving, saving, or updating `Transaction`, `Goal`, and `UserCategory` data.
- Allows easier testing and mocking of data sources.

---

###  Session Management (`data/session/`)
**Purpose:** Manages authentication state and user context throughout the app.

**Features:**
- Stores the authenticated userâ€™s ID locally.
- Ensures session continuity between app restarts.
- Used for filtering user-specific data in all views and repositories.

##  Installation

### Requirements

* Android Studio (version Arctic Fox or later)
* Java 11+
* Android SDK Platform 30 or above

### Setup Steps

```bash
git clone https://github.com/WisalELALOUAN1/GFP
cd GFP
```

1. Open the project in Android Studio.
2. Add your `google-services` for Firebase integration.
3. Run the app on an emulator or a physical device.

---

##  Application Screens

* **Login/Register Screens** (Email or Google)
* **Dashboard** ( total balance, latest transactions)
* **Add Transaction** (Form with category, amount, type)
* **Define Goal** (Set target amount, current savings, deadline)
* **Report Screen** (PDF export of all goals and transactions)

---

##  AI Model Integration

We use **TensorFlow Lite** to embed a trained model for predicting budget allocations. The model:

* Takes input parameters like category ID, current month, and day of week.
* Outputs estimated allocation per category.
* Normalizes inputs using MinMax scaling for better accuracy.
* Provides suggestions based on previous spending behavior.
